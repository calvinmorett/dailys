UFC 252: Stipe vs DC 

So far they've fought twice and they've been pretty even for the most part. DC won the first match-up, Stipe won the 2nd. Lets consult the data.

So it looks like Stipe has the most advantages according to the data. From just visually looking at the previous fights, neither fighter took each other down. They both have exceptional wrestling, so I think it sort of negates itself, the weight doesn't matter either because DC usually fights at a lower weight class, which also probably ties into a better WinLoss Ratio, which sort of negates that data in a way too, or at least puts less weight on those stats. So let's look at it again, with just more weight added in places it will matter, Striking; both fights have been ended with strikes so that seems to make sense that they will do it again.

```                                                                    
Stipe Miocic vs Daniel Cormier                                                        
---------------------                                                                        # Height | Point for Stipe Miocic

```

I personally would think Stipe has this fight, if it stays standing. It's almost anyone's game on the ground, and DC has been known to just keep people there with his high level wrestling.
So instead of 6 to 4, I would actually score this 4 to 1 Stipe with the most advantages. Cormiers wrestling is significantly negated and that is where he gains most of his advantages in fights, he does have good striking just not better than Stipe.

The last fight that DC lost, the majority of the fight I was scoring him to be winning. His coaches kept saying you're not doing well and I think that affected his mental state too much and made him try riskier things and not just keep in the pocket vs Stipe. The fact that he wasn't sure on how well he was doing sort of plays a part into how durable Stipe is. If it goes past round 1 Stipe should be the winner on stats alone, he's much more durable than DC, but the fact that this may be DC's last fight maybe will help him be mentally prepared to push into deeper rounds.


But if I were to write a major summary of how I feel, through clickbaity headline, I would write:

**Will DC's Last UFC Fight Spur him to Victory?**


The odds currently are 110 to 120, for Cormier as the favourite, so Vegas thinks it's anyone's game, but hedges their bets on DC. I personally like both of them as fighters, but Stipe is what the model favours, and so do I.
